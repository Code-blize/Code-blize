🎉 Code-blize
Smart. Curious. A little dramatic — but in a productive way.

Hi, I’m Obasi-Uzoma Blessing — a physics-trained brain currently building my kingdom in Data Science, Machine Learning, and a little bit of Web3 chaos. I write too.

- I learn fast, analyze deeply, and overthink professionally.
- If it’s data, I’ll make sense of it.
- If it’s code, I’ll debug it (eventually).
- If it’s a problem… I’m already solving it.

🚀 What I’m Currently Working On

- Leveling up in Python, SQL, ML & AI (obviously) 
- Applying physics logic to real-world data problems 
- Exploring Web3 without losing my mind 
- Building small projects that will someday look like big projects 😌

🧠 Tech Interests

- Data Science & Visualization 
- Machine Learning 
- AI Models 
- Physics-based modelling 
- Web3 & blockchain basics 

🔧 Tools I Use

- Python – My main coding wand 
- Pandas – Data wrangling made elegant 🐼 
- SQL – Talking to databases like a pro 💾 
- Google Colab – Cloud-powered experiments ☁️ 
- VS Code – Where the magic happens 💻 
- Git & GitHub – Version control and code playground 🌐 
- A brain that refuses to rest – Constantly curious 🤯

“Curiosity is my superpower. Overthinking is the side effect.”
